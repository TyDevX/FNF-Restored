# FNF Restored

* Most of the shit work besides the options menu (for reasons), and dialogue (which I'm working on).

* Anyways build with normal fnf build instructions

# Notes

* Don't ask how I found this

* I will remake some stuff that I can't fix

* Anyone's allowed to help.

# Current Bugs

* Dialogue doesn't work on weeks besides week 6 for some reason.

* Downscroll is broken lolz

* Settings/Options is still somewhat broken. (Might remake it and use the system I use for FX Engine.)
